    <h2>Few info about Golden State Warriors</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The Golden State Warriors, based in San Francisco, California, have a
        storied history in the NBA that spans several decades. The franchise was
        founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors and became a dominant force
        in the early years of the league. Led by legendary players like Wilt
        Chamberlain, the Warriors won the NBA championship in 1956, showcasing
        their early prowess. However, the team faced challenges in subsequent
        years before relocating to California in 1962 and ultimately becoming
        the Golden State Warriors in 1971. Despite some successful seasons, the
        Warriors experienced a period of inconsistency in the following decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        The turning point for the modern-era Warriors came in the 2009-2010
        season when the team drafted Stephen Curry, who would go on to
        revolutionize the game with his extraordinary shooting ability. Paired
        with fellow sharpshooter Klay Thompson and later joined by All-Star
        forward Draymond Green, the Warriors, under coach Steve Kerr, embarked
        on a historic run of success. They won NBA championships in 2015, 2017,
        and 2018, with a distinctive style known as "small ball" and a
        fast-paced, three-point shooting offense. The team's dominance,
        particularly during the 2015-2016 season when they set a regular-season
        record of 73 wins, solidified the Warriors as one of the greatest teams
        in NBA history. Despite facing challenges and injuries in subsequent
        seasons, the Warriors remain a formidable force in the league, with a
        legacy built on skill, teamwork, and a commitment to pushing the
        boundaries of the game.
