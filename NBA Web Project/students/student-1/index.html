          Hello, my name is Angelos Thanasai. Im a Computer Science student in

            >Athens Tech College</a
          >. I remember myself from a young age that I was into computers and
          especially into Cybersecurity field. My passion to learn more about
          the hacking techniques and how hackers think outside of the box was
          giving me goosebumbs and generally the whole concepts of how security
          works. Im taking into consideration a Master's degree in
          Cybersecurity. I also have experience in coding, and specifically in
          the Web Development path. I used to make website for clients and also
          for my personal interest, just for practice. I love to learn new
          things, I love also to play games, FPS preferably and some RTS. Im
          quite into series also and last but not least I am a dog owner which
          is an influence to me. I am an NBA fan
          <a id="boston" href="../../teams-webpages/celtics.html"
            >Boston Celtics is my favorite team</a
          >. I work as a bartender right now, I have 4 years experience in area
          of the bar. Thats it folks, you can find me on social media.
