    <h2>Few info about Dallas Mavericks</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The Dallas Mavericks, established in 1980, are a professional basketball
        team based in Dallas, Texas, and compete in the Western Conference of
        the National Basketball Association (NBA). The franchise was founded by
        Don Carter, an entrepreneur, and Norm Sonju, a former NBA executive. The
        team's name, Mavericks, was chosen to represent the independent and
        innovative spirit of the Texas region. Although the Mavericks struggled
        in their initial seasons, they experienced a turning point in the late
        1980s and early 1990s when they acquired key players like Dirk Nowitzki,
        who would go on to become the face of the franchise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2000s marked a significant era for the Mavericks under the
        leadership of Dirk Nowitzki and coach Don Nelson. The team consistently
        reached the playoffs, achieving success in the 2005-2006 season by
        making it to the NBA Finals but falling short against the Miami Heat.
        However, perseverance paid off in the 2010-2011 season when the
        Mavericks, led by Nowitzki and coached by Rick Carlisle, secured their
        first NBA championship by defeating the Miami Heat in a thrilling
        series. This victory solidified the Mavericks' place in NBA history and
        brought immense pride to the city of Dallas. Over the years, the
        Mavericks have continued to be a competitive force in the league, with a
        commitment to excellence and a legacy built on the shoulders of iconic
        players like Dirk Nowitzki, setting a standard of success for future
        generations of Mavericks to uphold.
