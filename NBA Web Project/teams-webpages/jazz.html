    <h2>Few info about Utah Jazz</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The Utah Jazz, based in Salt Lake City, have a rich history in the NBA
        since their establishment in 1974 as the New Orleans Jazz. The team
        relocated to Utah in 1979, and their early years were marked by
        struggles. However, the franchise underwent a transformation in the late
        1980s and early 1990s, led by the dynamic duo of John Stockton and Karl
        Malone. The Jazz became perennial contenders in the Western Conference,
        reaching the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, both times falling to the
        Chicago Bulls led by Michael Jordan. Despite the championship eluding
        them, the Stockton-Malone era solidified the Jazz as a respected and
        competitive franchise.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the years following the departure of Stockton and Malone, the Jazz
        continued to be a playoff contender, with notable players like Deron
        Williams and Carlos Boozer leading the team. The 2010s saw the emergence
        of a new generation of talent, including Donovan Mitchell and Rudy
        Gobert, who have reinvigorated the Jazz and brought them back into the
        postseason. With a mix of experienced veterans and promising young
        players, the Utah Jazz continue to build on their legacy, aiming to make
        a deep playoff run and add an NBA championship to their storied history.
