    <h2>Few info about Brooklyn Nets</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The Brooklyn Nets, a professional basketball team in the National
        Basketball Association (NBA), have a history rooted in their origins as
        the New Jersey Americans, founded in 1967. The franchise underwent
        several relocations and name changes before settling in Brooklyn. In
        1976, the team moved to New York and became the New York Nets, gaining
        prominence in the American Basketball Association (ABA) by winning two
        championships in 1974 and 1976. With the ABA-NBA merger in 1976, the
        franchise joined the NBA and underwent a series of relocations,
        including a stint in New Jersey as the New Jersey Nets.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012, the team moved to its current home in Brooklyn and rebranded as
        the Brooklyn Nets. This relocation marked a new era for the franchise,
        both geographically and in terms of identity. The team's move to
        Brooklyn coincided with a shift in roster dynamics, acquiring star
        players like Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving in subsequent years. The Nets
        have since become a formidable force in the NBA, known for their
        star-studded lineup and competitive performances in the Eastern
        Conference. The team's history reflects its journey from the ABA to the
        NBA, with Brooklyn serving as the latest chapter in its ongoing
        evolution.
