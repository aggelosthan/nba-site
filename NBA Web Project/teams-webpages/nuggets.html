    <h2>Few info about Denver Nuggets</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The Denver Nuggets have a compelling history in the NBA that dates back
        to their establishment in 1967 as an expansion team. The franchise
        originally began as the Denver Larks but quickly changed their name to
        the Denver Rockets. In 1974, the team rebranded once again, becoming the
        Denver Nuggets. Throughout the 1970s, the Nuggets experienced success in
        the American Basketball Association (ABA) under legendary coach Larry
        Brown. Players like David Thompson and Dan Issel became synonymous with
        the team during this era. The Nuggets transitioned to the NBA in 1976
        following the ABA-NBA merger, and their high-scoring style of play
        continued to define their identity.

      <p>
        One of the most iconic moments in Nuggets history occurred during the
        1984-85 season when the team engaged in a classic playoff series against
        the Los Angeles Lakers. The series, known as the "Miracle at Richfield,"
        featured memorable performances by Alex English and Kiki Vandeweghe but
        ultimately ended in a heartbreaking loss for the Nuggets in a decisive
        Game 5. Despite this setback, the Nuggets have remained a competitive
        force in the NBA, with notable periods of success, including the late
        2000s and recent years. The emergence of stars like Nikola Jokic and
        Jamal Murray has brought the team back into the playoff spotlight,
        making the Denver Nuggets a team to watch in the Western Conference.
