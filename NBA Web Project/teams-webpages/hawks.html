    <h2>Few info about Atlanta Hawks</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The Atlanta Hawks, founded in 1946 as the Buffalo Bisons in Buffalo, New
        York, before relocating and adopting their current name in 1968, have a
        diverse and intriguing history in the National Basketball Association
        (NBA). The franchise experienced its early success in St. Louis, where
        the team moved in 1955, winning the NBA Championship in 1958 behind the
        efforts of Hall of Famers Bob Pettit and Cliff Hagan. The relocation to
        Atlanta in 1968 marked a new chapter for the Hawks, and they continued
        to field competitive teams in the subsequent decades. Notable players
        such as Dominique Wilkins, Dikembe Mutombo, and Joe Johnson have left a
        lasting impact on the franchise, with Wilkins particularly renowned for
        his scoring prowess and iconic battles with Larry Bird in the 1980s.

      <p>
        In recent years, the Atlanta Hawks have experienced a resurgence, with a
        young and talented roster making significant strides in the Eastern
        Conference. This resurgence culminated in a notable playoff run,
        capturing attention and highlighting the team's potential for the
        future. Led by emerging stars like Trae Young, John Collins, and Clint
        Capela, the Hawks have embraced a dynamic style of play that emphasizes
        both offensive prowess and defensive tenacity. The team's commitment to
        developing its young core and fostering a winning culture reflects a
        promising era for the franchise. As the Atlanta Hawks continue to build
        on their historical legacy, they aim to solidify their presence as a
        competitive force in the NBA, showcasing the resilience and
        determination that characterize their ongoing journey in professional
        basketball.
