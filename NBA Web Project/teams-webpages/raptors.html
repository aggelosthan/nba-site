    <h2>Few info about Toronto Raptors</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The Toronto Raptors are a professional basketball team based in Toronto,
        Canada, and they are a member of the National Basketball Association
        (NBA). The team was established in 1995 as part of the NBA's expansion
        into Canada. The Raptors quickly gained popularity, especially after the
        drafting of Vince Carter in 1998, who became a franchise icon and played
        a crucial role in bringing attention to the team. The early years saw
        the Raptors making steady progress, but it was in the 2018-2019 NBA
        season that they achieved their greatest success. Led by superstar Kawhi
        Leonard and a talented roster, the Raptors won their first NBA
        championship by defeating the Golden State Warriors in a thrilling
        six-game series. The victory marked a historic moment for the franchise
        and solidified their place in the NBA's elite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, the Raptors have experienced both highs and lows, but
        they gained prominence in the 2010s. Led by players like Kyle Lowry and
        DeMar DeRozan, the team consistently reached the playoffs. The turning
        point came in the 2018-2019 season when the Raptors, under the guidance
        of coach Nick Nurse, clinched their first NBA Championship. This
        historic achievement was highlighted by Kawhi Leonard's stellar
        performance, and the Raptors defeated the Golden State Warriors in the
        NBA Finals. The victory solidified the Raptors' status as a force in the
        league and brought immense pride to basketball fans in Toronto and
        across Canada.
