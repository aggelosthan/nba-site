    <h2>Few info about San Antonio Spurs</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The San Antonio Spurs, founded in 1967, have established themselves as
        one of the most successful and consistently competitive franchises in
        NBA history. The team's early years were marked by a struggle to find
        sustained success, but a transformative period began in the late 1980s
        under the leadership of coach Gregg Popovich and center David Robinson.
        Popovich, who initially joined the team as an assistant coach, took over
        as head coach in 1996, and, along with Robinson, laid the foundation for
        the Spurs' dynasty. The duo led the Spurs to their first NBA
        championship in the strike-shortened 1998-1999 season, showcasing a
        blend of disciplined defense and efficient teamwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        The true hallmark of the Spurs' success came with the arrival of Tim
        Duncan, the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA Draft. Duncan, Popovich,
        and a supporting cast that included talents like Tony Parker and Manu
        Ginobili, formed the core of a team that went on to win multiple
        championships in the 2000s. The Spurs became synonymous with a selfless
        and strategic style of play, emphasizing ball movement, teamwork, and a
        commitment to both ends of the floor. The franchise went on to win NBA
        titles in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014, solidifying their legacy as
        one of the most successful dynasties in modern NBA history. The Spurs'
        sustained excellence, organizational stability, and adherence to
        fundamental basketball principles have made them a model franchise in
        professional sports.
