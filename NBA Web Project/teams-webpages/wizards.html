    <h2>Few info about Washington Wizards</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The Washington Wizards, previously known as the Washington Bullets,
        boast a rich NBA history. Established in 1961, the franchise initially
        played in Chicago before relocating to the nation's capital in 1973.
        Notably, the late 1970s and early 1980s marked a period of success under
        the leadership of Wes Unseld and Elvin Hayes. The team clinched its sole
        NBA championship in the 1977-78 season by defeating the Seattle
        SuperSonics in a seven-game series. Despite various ups and downs over
        subsequent decades, including the brief stint of Michael Jordan in the
        early 2000s, the franchise struggled to maintain consistent success.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, the Washington Wizards have experienced a positive
        shift. With Bradley Beal emerging as a star player and the acquisition
        of Russell Westbrook, the team has shown signs of improvement. Playoffs
        appearances and a renewed competitive spirit highlight the team's
        determination. Under the guidance of head coach Scott Brooks, the
        Wizards are striving to establish a winning culture. With a focus on
        player development, strategic moves in the draft, and a commitment to an
        up-tempo style of play, the franchise is poised for a promising future,
        aiming to build on its legacy and become a perennial contender in the
        Eastern Conference.
