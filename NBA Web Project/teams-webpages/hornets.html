    <h2>Few info about Charlotte Hornets</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        Established in 1988 as an expansion franchise, the Charlotte Hornets
        have etched a distinctive chapter in the annals of the National
        Basketball Association (NBA). The early years of the Hornets were
        nothing short of extraordinary, as they swiftly asserted themselves by
        clinching a playoff berth in just their second season and navigating
        their way to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Beyond their on-court
        prowess, the Hornets became synonymous with their vibrant teal and
        purple color scheme, capturing the imagination of fans across the
        nation. The era was defined by the charismatic presence of basketball
        luminaries like Larry Johnson, whose "Grandmama" persona became an
        iconic representation of the team's appeal, along with the formidable
        talents of Alonzo Mourning and the diminutive yet dynamic Muggsy Bogues.

        Following a brief relocation to New Orleans, the Hornets returned to
        Charlotte in 2004, heralding a renaissance for the franchise and
        reigniting the passionate enthusiasm of their dedicated fanbase. The
        subsequent years have witnessed a diverse tapestry of triumphs,
        including playoff appearances, and transitional phases characterized by
        strategic rebuilding efforts. The return to Charlotte marked a fresh
        narrative, with players like Kemba Walker carving their places as
        beloved figures in the team's history. In the contemporary NBA
        landscape, the Hornets continue to navigate challenges with an
        unwavering commitment to competitiveness, underscored by the development
        of promising young talents such as LaMelo Ball. Thus, the Hornets'
        distinctive history, adorned with iconic personalities and a steadfast
        pursuit of success, stands as a testament to their enduring presence and
        unique identity in the league.
