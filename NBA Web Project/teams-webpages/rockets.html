    <h2>Few info about Houston Rockets</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        Established in 1967 as an expansion team, the Houston Rockets have
        emerged as a dynamic force in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
        The team was founded by Robert Breitbard and was originally based in San
        Diego before moving to Houston in 1971. Early in their history, the
        Rockets faced challenges but began to find success in the 1980s under
        the leadership of iconic players like Hakeem Olajuwon. Known as "The
        Dream," Olajuwon became the face of the franchise and led the Rockets to
        back-to-back NBA championships in the 1993-1994 and 1994-1995 seasons,
        securing their place in NBA history. The team's commitment to excellence
        during this era solidified the Rockets as a powerhouse, and Olajuwon
        remains one of the greatest centers in the history of the sport.

        The Rockets continued to be competitive in subsequent years, with
        notable players like Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming making significant
        contributions. In recent times, the team underwent a transformative
        period, marked by the acquisition of James Harden, a prolific scorer and
        playmaker. Under Harden's leadership, the Rockets consistently made deep
        playoff runs, coming close to securing an NBA championship. Despite
        falling short, the Rockets have remained a formidable presence in the
        NBA landscape, continually striving for success and representing the
        city of Houston with pride. The team's rich history, marked by both
        triumphs and challenges, showcases the resilience and determination that
        characterize the Houston Rockets as a respected franchise in the world
        of professional basketball.
