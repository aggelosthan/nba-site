    <h2>Few info about New Orleans Pelicans</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The New Orleans Pelicans, established in 2002 as the New Orleans
        Hornets, later underwent a significant rebranding in 2013 to become the
        Pelicans, reflecting a connection to the region's rich cultural and
        natural heritage. The franchise relocated to New Orleans from Charlotte,
        North Carolina, where they were known as the Hornets. The early years in
        New Orleans were marked by both on-court struggles and moments of
        promise. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the team
        temporarily played home games in various cities before returning to New
        Orleans in 2007. Despite challenges, the Hornets became a resilient and
        integral part of the New Orleans community.

        The rebranding to the Pelicans coincided with a new era for the
        franchise. The team drafted Anthony Davis as the first overall pick in
        the 2012 NBA Draft, and he quickly became a cornerstone player. The
        Pelicans, with Davis leading the way, enjoyed some success in the
        Western Conference, making playoff appearances and advancing to the
        second round. However, Davis eventually sought a trade, leading to his
        departure from the team. The Pelicans, undeterred, pivoted toward a new
        era of building around emerging star Zion Williamson, the first overall
        pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. The young and talented roster, combined with
        the team's commitment to community engagement, has positioned the
        Pelicans as a team with potential for future success and a strong
        connection to the unique culture of New Orleans.
