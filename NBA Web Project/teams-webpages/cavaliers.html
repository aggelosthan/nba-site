    <h2>Few info about Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        The Cleveland Cavaliers are a professional basketball team based in
        Cleveland, Ohio, competing in the Eastern Conference of the National
        Basketball Association (NBA). The franchise was established in 1970, and
        its history has been marked by both highs and lows. The Cavaliers gained
        widespread recognition in 2003 when they selected LeBron James as the
        first overall pick in the NBA Draft. LeBron's tenure with the team,
        particularly from 2003 to 2010 and then again from 2014 to 2018,
        propelled the Cavaliers to multiple playoff appearances and their
        historic NBA Championship victory in 2016. Despite facing challenges in
        the post-LeBron era, the Cavaliers continue to be a resilient and
        evolving team, focusing on developing young talent and building a
        competitive roster for the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly! In recent years, the Cleveland Cavaliers have strategically
        shifted their focus towards rebuilding and developing a young, promising
        roster. With an emphasis on the NBA Draft, the Cavaliers have secured
        key talents such as Collin Sexton and Darius Garland, both of whom have
        shown considerable potential and growth. Sexton, a dynamic guard known
        for his scoring ability, and Garland, a skilled playmaker with a smooth
        shooting stroke, form a foundation for the Cavaliers' future. Under the
        leadership of head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, the team has been committed
        to instilling a competitive spirit and a hardworking ethos in its
        players. The Cavaliers' front office has also made strategic moves in
        the offseason to complement their young core, adding experienced players
        to provide leadership and mentorship. This blend of youth and veteran
        presence positions the Cavaliers as a team on the rise, eager to make
        strides in the Eastern Conference and compete at a higher level in the
        NBA. As Cleveland continues to invest in its young talent and build a
        cohesive unit, fans are optimistic about the team's potential for
        sustained success in the years ahead.
