    <h2>Few info about Milwauke Bucks</h2>
    <div class="team_info">
      <p>
        Established in 1968 as an expansion team in the National Basketball
        Association (NBA), the Milwaukee Bucks swiftly left an indelible mark on
        the league's landscape. The Bucks' inaugural seasons were highlighted by
        an extraordinary achievement in just their third year, as they clinched
        the NBA Championship in 1971. Spearheaded by the transcendent talent of
        Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and complemented by
        the skills of basketball legend Oscar Robertson, the Bucks showcased an
        exceptional debut season. Abdul-Jabbar's dominance in the paint and
        scoring prowess propelled Milwaukee to its first and, as of now, only
        championship. The early success of the Bucks not only solidified their
        position in NBA history but also set the foundation for a legacy that
        would continue to evolve over the ensuing decades.

        Throughout the years, the Bucks have navigated various phases of
        competitiveness. The team experienced a renaissance in the 1980s,
        characterized by the emergence of stars like Sidney Moncrief and the
        formation of the formidable "Big Three" consisting of Moncrief, Paul
        Pressey, and Terry Cummings. Despite facing challenges in subsequent
        decades, the franchise found renewed success in the 2010s, with the
        ascension of Giannis Antetokounmpo. Under Antetokounmpo's leadership,
        the Bucks became a dominant force in the Eastern Conference, culminating
        in their triumph in the 2021 NBA Championship, ending a 50-year title
        drought. The Bucks' storied history reflects a blend of triumphs,
        rebuilding efforts, and a persistent commitment to excellence,
        showcasing the team's resilience and enduring impact in the dynamic
        realm of the NBA.
